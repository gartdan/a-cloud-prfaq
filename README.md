# AWS Becomes "A Cloud", an Independent Entity

### A Cloud is freed to address all of the multi-trillion dollar IT marketplace

### Goldman Sachs to lead A Cloud IPO - launch customers include Walmart and Apple

SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--December 1, 2020-- Today, at AWS re:Invent, 
Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy jointly announced A Cloud, a new Delaware 
corporation which will assume ownership of all of Amazon Web Services'
assets and become the employer of existing AWS employes.  This 
will make A Cloud's services more attractive to customers who
compete with Amazon in one or more market segments, and free
Amazon.com to build proprietary IT infrastructure where A Cloud
services don't fully meet its needs. To get started with A Cloud,

AWS has become the leading public-cloud provider, offering the widest 
range of services backed by the strongest security, availability,
and data-protection infrastructure.  Now, organizations who compete
with Amazon want to take advantages of AWS's industry-leading 
offerings without having to question whether they are strengthening 
a competitor. 

From the AWS-customer point of view, the experience will be seamless.
All existing AWS services will continue to operate exactly as before wth no 
changes of any kind required in any customer application.

"AWS is one of the Amazon.com creations of which I'm most
proud", said Jeff Bezos. "Its success at improving the cost,
security, and performance of large and small organizations across
the business, government, education, and nonprofit sectors 
constitutes a major contribution to the way everyone uses technology.
Now it's time for it to spread its wings and address the whole
IT market, end to end and top to bottom."

Andy Jassy, CEO of A Cloud, said "We owe everything to Jeff's
leadership team, and everyone at A Cloud joins me in a hearty 
thank-you. Now it's time for our A Cloud team to obsess even 
harder at understanding and meeting customer needs across 
the IT horizon."

Following on A Cloud's IPO, to be managed by Goldman Sachs, the
company will acquire all current AWS assets from Amazon.com
for a one-time payment of $100 billion, and a 20% equity stake in 
A Cloud. Jeff Bezos has agreed to join the A Cloud Board of 
Directors, but will not seek nor accept the Chairmanship.

A Cloud will continue the rapid pace of innovation for which AWS
has been acclaimed, without ever losing focus on delivering
the best security and uptime available from any vendor. A Cloud
looks forward to serving Amazon.com as a customer, but understands
that Amazon may choose to operate some of its own data 
infrastructure to meet specific needs or location requirements
that would not be well-served by A Cloud.

"Walmart.com operates the world's second-largest online retail
offering, and has developed a world-class customer-facing 
shopping interface" said Doug McMillon, Walmart CEO. "We don't
see software infrastructure as a core competence and have 
agreed in principle to transfer our applications to run on 
A Cloud infrastructure. We expect the savings to be massive,
without any loss of responsiveness or security."

"Apple iCloud has become an essential part of the custoer experience
on iPhone, iPad, and Mac" said Tim Cook, Apple CEO. "We look forward
to relying on A Cloud services to strengthen iCloud without
any concerns about it competing with Apple in any of our
business segments."

"AWS has served Amazon.com retail superbly for fifteen 
years now" said Jeff Wilke, CEO:Worldwide Consumer at 
Amazon.com. "We're confident that A Cloud will continue 
to support our retail operations with the reliability,
security, and attention to detail that we've come to 
rely on.  There are a few select areas and geographies
where we plan to build some very Amazon-retail-specific
infrastructure, but for general-pupose public-cloud 
services, we're all-in on A Cloud".

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What are you launching?**

We are launching A Cloud, a new corporate entity of which
Amazon.com will be a shareholder but will not exercise 
equity or management control. It will assume all the 
assets, operations, and employees of Amazon Web Services.

**2. Why is this good for AWS customers?**

AWS has been scrupulous in declaring and ensuring that
customers own their own data and that it is not accessed
by anyone unauthorized, including any AWS employees.  
However, some organizations are strategically reluctant to
commit business-critical software and data to infrastructure
owned and operated by an organization whose parent
corporation may be one of their competitors. 

With the arrival of A Cloud, this strategic concern 
vanishes.  Customers can choose between A Cloud and one
of its public-cloud competitors strictly on the basis 
of the range, quality, and pricing of the services on
offer. 

**3. Why is this good for Amazon.com?**

As a matter of policy, Amazon.com services are strongly
encourage to host on AWS services, as opposed to 
purpose-built Amazon retail technologies. The price 
paid by Amazon.com groups for AWS is an internal 
transfer price, and there is room for debate as 
to its fairness both to Amazon.com and to AWS.

Obviously, since Amazon.com will be a large customer
of A Cloud, it will not be paying list prices. But
the prices will be be denominated in real money and
there will be no suspicion that either party is 
accepting an unreasonable deal.

Additionally, there may be certain Amazon.com services
that, for locational or technical reasons, are 
difficult to port to AWS. With the launch of A Cloud,
Amazon.com regains the option of building and running
its own infrastructure where appropriate, or even 
choosing in some cases to use a competitive public 
cloud provider.

**4. Will AWS pricing change?**

AWS has a track record of regular price cuts. There is
no reason to expect that this will change.

**5. How do I switch from AWS to A Cloud technology?"

You don't have to do anything.  All the existing 
APIs and endpoints and services will work exactly
as before. 

**6. Why the corporate transaction structure, with the large buyout and 20% equity stake?**

Amazon.com has invested hugely in the creation and
growth of AWS.  It is now enjoying a substantial profit
stream which it has fairly earned, and the subtraction
of which might cause financial stress as Amazon.com
continues its focus on customer-obsessed growth.

This transaction gives Amazon.com a large financial
reward, equivalent to several years of AWS profit,
plus a potential long-term reward as a consequence
of its 20% equity stake in A Cloud.

Simultaneously, the IPO gives the investing community
a chance to partipate in A Cloud's demonstrated ability
to grow quickly while operating at a substantial 
positive margin.
